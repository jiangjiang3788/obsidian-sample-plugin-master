This is your vault that will be used during the end to end tests. You can put whatever you want in
here.

You can omit the `.obsidian` directory to have Obsidian generate it with the default settings, or
you can commit it to start the vault with customized configuration. You can setup and switch
between multiple test vaults as well.
